Although an insidious history of episodic memory difﬁculty is a typical presenting symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, detailed
neuropsychological proﬁling frequently demonstrates deﬁcits in other cognitive domains, including language. Previous studies
from our group have shown that language changes may be reﬂected in connected speech production in the earliest stages of
typical Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of the present study was to identify features of connected speech that could be used to
examine longitudinal proﬁles of impairment in Alzheimer’s disease. Samples of connected speech were obtained from 15 former
participants in a longitudinal cohort study of ageing and dementia, in whom Alzheimer’s disease was diagnosed during life and
conﬁrmed at post-mortem. All patients met clinical and neuropsychological criteria for mild cognitive impairment between 6 and
18 months before converting to a status of probable Alzheimer’s disease. In a subset of these patients neuropsychological data
were available, both at the point of conversion to Alzheimer’s disease, and after disease severity had progressed from the mild
to moderate stage. Connected speech samples from these patients were examined at later disease stages. Spoken language
samples were obtained using the Cookie Theft picture description task. Samples were analysed using measures of syntactic
complexity, lexical content, speech production, ﬂuency and semantic content. Individual case analysis revealed that subtle
changes in language were evident during the prodromal stages of Alzheimer’s disease, with two-thirds of patients with mild
cognitive impairment showing signiﬁcant but heterogeneous changes in connected speech. However, impairments at the mild
cognitive impairment stage did not necessarily entail deﬁcits at mild or moderate stages of disease, suggesting non-language
inﬂuences on some aspects of performance. Subsequent examination of these measures revealed signiﬁcant linear trends over
the three stages of disease in syntactic complexity, semantic and lexical content. The ﬁndings suggest, ﬁrst, that there is a
progressive disruption in language integrity, detectable from the prodromal stage in a subset of patients with Alzheimer’s
disease, and secondly that measures of semantic and lexical content and syntactic complexity best capture the global progres-
sion of linguistic impairment through the successive clinical stages of disease. The identiﬁcation of disease-speciﬁc language
impairment in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease could enhance clinicians’ ability to distinguish probable Alzheimer’s disease from
changes attributable to ageing, while longitudinal assessment could provide a simple approach to disease monitoring in thera-
peutic trials.


Materials and methods

One of the most important clinical clues to a diagnosis of probable
Alzheimer’s disease is an insidious history of learning and memory
difﬁculties, often noticed by others, and sufﬁcient to impact on
performance of day-to-day activities (McKhann et al., 1984;
Dubois et al., 2007). Detailed neuropsychological proﬁling of
such patients, however, frequently demonstrates deﬁcits across a
range of other cognitive faculties, including higher visual process-
ing (Locascio et al., 1995; Rouleau et al., 1996), frontal executive
function (Laﬂeche and Albert, 1995; Bondi et al., 2002), and lan-
guage abilities (Locascio et al., 1995; Garrard et al., 2001). With
progression of the disease, problems in all these additional do-
mains become more prominent, leading to a typical end stage
of global cognitive impairment (for review see Albert, 2011).

Much attention has been paid to the evolution of language
change over the course of Alzheimer’s disease, as both retrospect-
ive analyses of written and spoken language dating from presymp-
tomatic periods (Snowdon et al., 1996; Garrard et al., 2005; van
Velzen and Garrard, 2008), and prospective cohort studies of
ageing populations (Forbes-McKay and Venneri, 2005; Oulhaj
et al., 2009), have shown that subtle changes in language and
communication ability may be apparent years or even decades
before either a patient or his/her closest associates becomes
aware of any symptoms of cognitive deterioration.

Translation of these striking observations into simple and spe-
ciﬁc markers of language change in Alzheimer’s disease could
have far-reaching clinical consequences. The effortlessness of con-
nected speech production in daily life makes it an easy biological
sample to obtain, while the informational complexity of the data
provides a multitude of analytical dimensions. The identiﬁcation of
disease-speciﬁc language abnormalities in patients with prodromal
Alzheimer’s disease, or mild cognitive impairment (Petersen et al.,
1999; Gauthier et al., 2006), would therefore enhance clinicians’
ability to distinguish probable Alzheimer’s disease from the more
benign effects of ageing on cognition, while longitudinal assess-
ment
could provide readily obtainable markers of disease
progression.

We recently examined connected speech samples obtained at
the time of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis from a series of patients
in whom Alzheimer’s disease was subsequently conﬁrmed at post-
mortem. We found evidence of syntactic simpliﬁcation (Ahmed
et al., 2012) and impairments in lexico-semantic processing
(Ahmed et al., 2013), in keeping with previous studies in clinically
deﬁned populations (Hier et al., 1985; Croisile et al., 1996; Giles
et al., 1996; Vuorinen et al., 2000). The fact that these samples
were drawn from a longitudinal study of ageing and dementia
means that connected speech, along with other indices of lan-
guage and cognition, can be serially assayed, capturing perform-
ance at both the mild cognitive impairment stage and later phases
of disease progression in the same group of individuals. The
objective of the present study was, therefore, to identify the
features of connected speech that: (i) had been abnormal during
the mild cognitive impairment phase of these patients’ illness; and
(ii) showed consistently greater deviation from normal perform-
ance with disease progression.

Participants

All participants had been recruited to the Oxford Project to Investigate
Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA), a longitudinal study of the clinical,
neuropsychological, biochemical and imaging correlates of ageing in
community dwelling elderly persons with and without dementia [see
Oulhaj et al. (2009) for fuller description of the OPTIMA design].
Ahmed et al. (2012) described the abnormalities present in the con-
nected speech of 36 members of the OPTIMA cohort who had
enrolled in the study between 1989 and 2006, either while cognitively
healthy or with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment according to
the Petersen et al. (1999, 2001) criteria. Eighteen members of this
group had later progressed to meet criteria for probable Alzheimer’s
disease, and the remaining participants continued to display normal
cognition. All participants had been followed serially at 6 to
12 month intervals until death, and all brains submitted for post-
mortem histological examination. Diagnoses of deﬁnite Alzheimer’s
disease [according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for
Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) criteria (Mirra et al., 1991)], with
Braak stage V/VI neuroﬁbrillary tangle density (Braak and Braak,
1991), had been found in all progressors, whereas minimal or no
Alzheimer’s disease pathology had been present in control brain tissue.
For the present study we selected, from the same group of partici-
pants, all those for whom clinical and neuropsychological evaluation
had supported a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment between 6
and 18 months before the ﬁrst assessment that had led to a classiﬁ-
cation of probable Alzheimer’s disease. Data at the mild cognitive
impairment stage were unavailable in 3 of 18 patients. Cross-sectional
data from 15 healthy elderly control participants, age and education
matched and with no signiﬁcant difference in gender ratio, were con-
secutively selected from the OPTIMA database as a comparison group.
The absence of Alzheimer’s disease changes from all control brains was
conﬁrmed at post-mortem. The demographic characteristics of the
patient subgroups and the matched control samples are displayed in
Table 1.

To examine language performance at later disease stages, we fur-
ther selected those participants for whom neuropsychological data
were available both at the point of conversion to Alzheimer’s disease,
and after disease severity had progressed from the mild (Mini-
Mental State Examination 21–24) to moderate (Mini-Mental State
Examination 10–20) stage. Data were available in nine patients, for
whom nine age and education matched healthy elderly controls were
selected as a comparison group. The demographic characteristics of
patients at three clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive
impairment, mild and moderate stage) and the matched control sam-
ples are displayed in Table 2. Detailed information on selection criteria
for each phase of the study can be found in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Cognitive and linguistic assessment

All OPTIMA participants were evaluated using the CAMDEX interview
(Roth et al., 1986), which incorporates the CAMCOG, a brief neuro-
psychological battery focusing on cognitive abilities important to a
diagnosis of dementia, namely: orientation, comprehension, expres-
sion, recent memory, remote memory,
learning, abstract thinking,
perception, praxis, attention and calculation. The Mini-Mental State
Examination score was also extracted from the CAMCOG for all
participants.

S. Ahmed et al.

The language component of

the CAMCOG includes elicitation
of a sample of connected speech using the Cookie Theft picture
description task from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination
(Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983). As all assessments were routinely
tape recorded, speech samples were available for transcription and
further analysis.

Cookie Theft descriptions were transcribed following the conven-
tions described by Garrard et al. (2011), and analysed using the
method described by Wilson et al. (2010), with minor adaptations
as documented in Ahmed et al. (2012). This approach uses the clas-
siﬁcation of normal and abnormal discourse proposed by Saffran et al.
(1989), and uses the quantitative production analysis techniques
described by Berndt et al. (2000). Brieﬂy, the variables analysed
were grouped under four headings: (i) speech production (speech
rate, distortions, and phonological paraphasias); (ii) syntactic complex-
ity (mean length of utterance, proportion of words in sentences,
number of embedded clauses, syntactic errors, nouns preceded by
determiners and verbs with inﬂections); (iii) lexical content [propor-
tional frequencies of open class (nouns, verbs and descriptive terms)
and closed class (grammatical function) words]; and (iv) ﬂuency errors
repaired sequences, ﬁlled pauses and incomplete
(false starts,
sentences).

Semantic content of the samples was quantiﬁed separately, using
the semantic units classiﬁcation described by Croisile et al. (1996), in
which 23 units, relating to the four components of the picture, are
assumed to constitute a complete description of the pictured scene:
three subjects (boy, girl and mother), two locations (kitchen and
exterior seen through the window), 11 objects (cookie,
jar, stool,
sink, plate, dishcloth, water, window, cupboard, dishes and curtains),
and seven actions or attitudes (boy taking or stealing, boy or stool
falling, woman drying or washing dishes/plate, water overﬂowing or
spilling, action performed by the girl, woman unconcerned by the
overﬂowing, woman indifferent to the children). Two additional meas-
ures—idea density (deﬁned as the total number of semantic units
divided by total number of words in a speech sample) and efﬁciency
(the total number of semantic units divided by duration of the speech
sample in seconds)—were also computed (Ahmed et al., 2013).

All analyses were restricted to utterances connected with the stimu-
lus picture, and ignored unrelated comments such as questions about
the task or conversations with the examiner. Transcripts were analysed
by two raters, resulting in good initial inter-rater agreement, and later
consensus on all points of discrepancy.

Statistical analysis

Linguistic variable scores were converted to z-scores using the control
means and standard deviations. For those measures (i.e. error rates
items) on which higher raw scores
lexical
or counts of individual
were associated with greater cognitive impairment,
the sign of
the z-scores were reversed, allowing all ﬁgures and corresponding
tables to be read as
lower scores indicating more impairment.
Independent samples t-tests were used to compare demographic
and cognitive measures between controls and patients. Mann-
Whitney U-tests were used to compare linguistic measures between
controls and patients, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare
linguistic measures between the clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease
(i.e. mild cognitive impairment, mild and moderate stage Alzheimer’s
disease). Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied
to all P-values. Finally, a repeated measures ANOVA was used to
investigate linear
in the quantitative production analysis
variables, followed by paired sample t-tests to investigate differences
between clinical stages.

Results

Connected speech abnormalities at the
mild cognitive impairment stage

Performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination and all subt-
ests of the CAMCOG other than those relating to comprehension,
perception and calculation were signiﬁcantly lower in the mild
cognitive impairment group than those of control subjects, but
the mean score was still above the dementia cut-off of 80/107
In contrast, and in agreement with the ﬁndings in the
points.
larger Alzheimer’s disease cohort
reported by Ahmed et al.
(2012), only scores on the calculation subtest of the CAMCOG
were comparable with control performance when participants had
reached the stage of mild Alzheimer’s disease (Table 1).

Figure 1 displays (in the form of z-scores) all the quantitative
production analysis and semantic content measures on which at
least one transcript was associated with a score that fell 1.5 or
more standard deviations below the control mean. Each speech
variable is associated with two bars, the light grey bar representing
performance at the mild cognitive impairment stage, and the dark
grey bar performance at the mild Alzheimer’s disease stage.

Figure 1 shows that deﬁcits were found in all mild cognitive
impairment transcripts: 11 of 15 patients showed impairment in
syntactic complexity and semantic content that was also observed
as disease progressed to the early Alzheimer’s disease stage; six
showed impairments in speech production and four in ﬂuency
errors, whereas only two patients showed changes in lexical con-
tent. However, Fig. 1 also indicates that a small proportion (8.2%)
of the abnormalities associated with the mild cognitive impairment
transcripts had become attenuated (i.e. improved but still within
the impaired range), and 20% had disappeared entirely by the
time the same patient met criteria for Alzheimer’s disease.
Statistical comparison of group performance (Fig. 1) between
mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer’s disease stage on
each of the individual linguistic indices, showed no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences after correction for multiple comparisons, though group
differences in mean length of utterance (P = 0.01) and syntactic
errors (P = 0.03) approached signiﬁcance.

Language markers of Alzheimer’s
disease progression

In the patient subgroup for whom language samples were avail-
able for transcription and analysis at the moderate Alzheimer’s
disease stage, and their matched controls, patients performed at
signiﬁcantly lower levels at all clinical stages on the Mini-Mental
State Examination, CAMCOG total, orientation, expression,
remote and recent memory (Table 2). Patients were signiﬁcantly
impaired on comprehension and praxis at the mild and moderate
stages, and on attention, calculation and perception at
the
moderate stage only. There was no signiﬁcant difference between
controls and patients at any clinical stage on abstract thinking.

To identify the language variables that were likely to be useful
as markers of cognitive change with clinical progression, we
considered all variables on which the majority of cases showed a

Connected speech in Alzheimer’s disease

Brain 2013: 136; 3727–3737 | 3731

consistent decline across the stages of mild cognitive impairment
and early Alzheimer’s disease (that is to say, cases in which
impairment at the mild Alzheimer’s disease stage either appeared
de novo or was more profound than that seen at the mild cogni-
tive impairment stage). The variables remaining (and the linguistic
domains to which they belonged) after this criterion was applied
were: speech rate (speech production); ﬁlled pauses (ﬂuency
errors); proportions of pronouns and verbs (lexical content);
proportion of words in sentences, syntactic errors, proportions of

nouns with determiners and verbs with inﬂections (syntactic com-
plexity); total semantic units and references to objects, subjects
and actions, efﬁciency and idea density (semantic processing).
These measures were used to examine the longitudinal proﬁles
of the nine patients whose connected speech at the moderate
dementia stage was available for characterization.

Figure 2 shows the individual and group average language
proﬁles of these patients across all three clinical stages. An increase
in the production of pronouns, decrease in total semantic units

Each linguistic variable is associated with two bars. The light grey bar corresponds to performance at the mild cognitive impairment stage,
and the dark grey bar corresponds to performance at the mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stage. Numerical values of all z-scores are provided

and decrease in efﬁciency, showed a pattern of increasing impair-
ment from the mild cognitive impairment stage through disease in
over half of the patients, with the remaining patients showing
impairments that were more variable. Consistent reductions in
the identiﬁcation of objects and actions were also noted in the
majority of patients, but beginning later in the disease at the
mild Alzheimer’s disease stage.

Statistical comparisons of group performance (Fig. 2) between
each clinical stage showed no signiﬁcant differences after correc-
tion for multiple comparisons (expected with the small numbers
involved). However, without application of stringent corrections,
there were a number of comparisons between mild cognitive im-
pairment and moderate stage Alzheimer’s disease that were
signiﬁcant. These differences were evident in the proportion of
pronouns (P = 0.01), total semantic units (P = 0.05), references
to objects
idea density (P = 0.02) and efﬁciency
(P = 0.02).

(P = 0.02),

To deﬁne more robust measures of progression, we grouped the
variables by linguistic domain, and computed a composite score
of
language performance speciﬁc to each domain. Language
composite scores were derived by ﬁrst computing z-scores as a
function of
for each variable, and then
averaging the z-scores of the constituent variables under each
linguistic domain. These values were used to explore the possibility
that composite measures might show a more consistent decline
through the disease stages.

The results of composite analysis are shown in the right columns of
Fig. 2. Although inconsistencies remained, they were fewer, so that
the trajectory of decline mirrored disease stage in the majority of
cases. Semantic content and syntactic complexity were the most
frequently observed deﬁcits, and decline on both these measures
could be detected at the mild cognitive impairment stage.

We then looked for statistically signiﬁcant trends in the decline
of language performance. Because of the small sample size and
the large number of individual variables, only composite scores

Discussion

Few longitudinal studies have monitored language performance
from mild cognitive impairment through to later stages of the
disease. Tomoeda and Bayles (1993)
followed three patients
with Alzheimer’s disease longitudinally and, using the Cookie
Theft description task, found that a reduction in conciseness was
the best method for differentiating patients from controls, and the
reduction of information units was the best measure of decline
over time. In a larger longitudinal study, Tomoeda et al. (1996)
examined ﬁve mild cognitive impairment patients and a larger
group of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, conﬁrming previous
ﬁndings, and additionally reporting an increase in ideational repe-
titions. Clinical conﬁrmation of conversion to Alzheimer’s disease
was, however, not available for patients with mild cognitive
impairment in either study.
In light of the variable conversion
rate in this group, such information is critical.

The present study documented the changes that took place in
spoken discourse over the course of three well-deﬁned clinical
stages in nine patients, and is therefore not only the largest, but
the ﬁrst of its kind to have been conducted in patients with later
neuropathological conﬁrmation of the presence of the disease.
First, the ﬁndings suggested that subtle changes in spoken lan-
guage may be evident during prodromal stages of Alzheimer’s
disease; and second that it was possible to derive measures of
language function whose changing values mirrored global progres-
sion through the successive clinical stages of disease.

We began by adopting an individual case analysis, since reliance
on group comparisons would have overlooked the spectrum of
individual proﬁles of impairment. The results showed that there
were signiﬁcant changes in language in two-thirds of the group,
an average of 12 months before clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease. It was also clear, however, that the abnormalities found
were heterogeneous rather than conforming to a common proﬁle.
The latter is consistent with the heterogeneity typically observed in
clinically probable Alzheimer’s disease in contrast to the more
stereotyped patterns of language abnormality that are associated
with the syndromes of primary progressive aphasia (Gorno-
Tempini et al., 2011).

Scrutiny of the pattern of evolution of these deﬁcits at two later
disease stages—newly diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease and moder-
ate Alzheimer’s disease—suggested that abnormal performance on
some aspect of discourse production at an earlier disease stage did
not guarantee abnormality at later stages, implying that at least
some of the measures were sensitive not only to deteriorating
cognition but also to attentional, motivational, affective or other
unstable inﬂuences on cognitive performance [though cognitive
ﬂuctuation has also been described in the context of Alzheimer’s
disease (Hodges et al., 2006)]. There is also evidence that casts
doubt on the test–retest reliability of smaller samples of connected
speech: Brookshire and Nicholas (1994) examined this property of
three linguistic measures (words per minute, correct information
per min, and per cent correct information units), in both small
(5100 words) and larger samples of connected speech, and
argued that these measures did not produce reliably similar sets
of values when smaller samples were examined. Speech rate

corresponded to words per minute studied by Brookshire and
Nicholas (1994), and the instability of this measure across multiple
testing episodes was conﬁrmed by our
results. The other of
Brookshire and Nicholas’s (1994) measures (correct information
per minute and per cent correct information units) mapped to
our efﬁciency and total semantic unit measures, and these were
among the indices that showed a largely consistent increase in
impairment at successive disease stages, though both remained
within the normal range throughout the period of follow-up in
four and three patients, respectively, of the nine studied.

In general, the majority of individual measures that could be
quantiﬁed using quantitative production analysis either differed
from normal controls in only a small number of cases (e.g. the
proportion of verbs used), or were subject to marked ﬂuctuation
over successive test sessions (e.g. the number of words in sen-
tences), or both (e.g. the rate of ﬁlled pauses). In an attempt to
detect a signal amid this obvious noise, we derived a series of
composite scores that reﬂected performance within each of the
domains of assessment covered by quantitative production ana-
lysis, together with a semantic composite. Of these, we found that
the semantic, syntactic complexity and lexical content composites,
but not speech production or ﬂuency, showed statistically signiﬁ-
cant changes with disease progression. The overall direction of
change in these variables was one of consistent deterioration
with increasing disease. Furthermore, signiﬁcant differences on
these variables were found between controls and the mild
Alzheimer’s disease stage, and importantly between mild cognitive
impairment and moderate stages of disease, conﬁrming the sig-
niﬁcant decline in these linguistic functions.

A decline in semantic content is consistent with previous ﬁnd-
ings from our group (Ahmed et al., 2013) and others (Nicholas
et al., 1985), that connected spoken discourse in early Alzheimer’s
disease is characterized by ‘empty’ speech, containing a high pro-
portion of words and utterances that communicate little or no
information. The accompanying decline in syntactic complexity
was in line with the ﬁndings of our recent cross-sectional study
of connected speech in mild Alzheimer’s disease (Ahmed et al.,
2012). The change in lexical content was largely driven by an
increase in the use of pronouns, a ﬁnding that has been reported
by others (Ripich and Terrell, 1988; Almor et al., 1999), and
attributed by one study to an underlying impairment of working
memory (Almor et al., 1999).

There were no signiﬁcant changes in ﬂuency or in speech pro-
duction (in particular phonological errors and distortion of speech)
over the course of disease. We have previously asked the question
of whether the syndrome of isolated, progressive logopenic apha-
sia, in which Alzheimer’s disease has been found to be the most
commonly underlying pathological process (Gorno-Tempini et al.,
2008; Rohrer et al., 2012), may be a clinical feature of typical
Alzheimer’s disease (Ahmed et al., 2012). Logopenic aphasia is
characterized by slow production rate and sparse phonological
paraphasias (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2008, 2011). Even at 2 years
post-diagnosis, these core clinical features of logopenic aphasia
remained largely absent in typical Alzheimer’s disease, lending fur-
ther support to our earlier conclusion that logopenic aphasia is a
clinical variant,
feature, of Alzheimer’s
than a clinical
disease.

In conclusion, we suggest that in a subset of patients with
Alzheimer’s disease there is progressive disruption in language
integrity, detectable from prodromal stages, which is best captured
by measures of semantic and lexical content and syntactic com-
plexity. The circumstances under which the data were acquired
allowed the stages of disease evolution to be accurately deﬁned,
and the availability of pathological diagnoses left no doubt about
the nature of the degenerative lesion. However, the small volumes
of language sampled and the susceptibility of such samples to
variation across test sessions means that more intensive language
sampling in a larger, independent cohort of patients is required in
order
to validate these ﬁndings. Correlating such language
changes with anatomical differences on MRI [as Wilson et al.
(2010) did in primary progressive aphasia], would add a valuable
neuroanatomical dimension to the data. When these additional
studies are accomplished, we believe that they will have at least
three important clinical
implications for the study of language
change in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative de-
mentias. First, an improved understanding of language deﬁcits in
Alzheimer’s disease would guide the development of methods for
improving communication between patients and their caregivers.
Second, comparing deﬁcits in speciﬁc aspects of connected speech
in Alzheimer’s disease would contribute to the development of
biologically important
the condition.
Finally, language monitoring could represent a simple, rapid and
reproducible approach to disease monitoring in therapeutic trials
aimed at slowing progression and cognitive deterioration.
