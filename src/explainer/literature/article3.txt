Objective: This study aims to document the nature and progression of
the spontaneous writing impairment observed in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) over a 12-month period using both a cross-
sectional and prospective longitudinal design.
Methods: Thirty-one minimal–moderate AD patients and 30 controls
matched for age and socio-cultural background completed a simple and
complex written description task at baseline. The AD patients then had
follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months.
Results: Cross-sectional comparisons indicated that minimal–moderate
AD patients produced more semantic paraphasias, phonological
paraphasias, and empty and indeﬁnite phrases, whilst producing fewer
pictorial themes, repairing fewer errors, and producing shorter and less
complex sentences than controls. The two groups could not be
distinguished on visual paraphasias. Longitudinal follow-up, however,
suggested that visual processing deteriorates over time, where the
prevalence of visual errors increased over 12 months.
Discussion: The ﬁndings suggest that the deterioration of writing skills
observed in the spontaneous writings of AD patients shows a pattern of
impairment dominated by semantic errors with a secondary impairment
in phonological processing, which is later joined by a disruption of
visuospatial and graphomotor processing.



Signiﬁcant outcomes

> Use of a simple and complex written picture description task can reliably discriminate the performance

of healthy elderly controls and minimal–moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients.

> The ﬁndings indicate the need for a screening task that assesses multiple components of language.
> The inclusion of lexico-semantic language measures in screening assessments would increase their initial
sensitivity, whereas visuospatial and graphomotor measures would be useful in documenting the
progression of the disease.

Limitations

> The longitudinal ﬁndings are limited by subject attrition; as a result, the analyses and conclusions drawn

are based on a small sample, thus limiting the wider application of the ﬁndings.

> Although the sample included minimal, mild and moderate AD patients, they could not be sub-grouped

for disease severity owing to the small sample size.

Introduction

Alois Alzheimer’s ﬁrst case report described a
woman of 51 years who ‘[w]hen writing repeated
individual syllables several times, left out others and

quickly became stranded’
(1); however, most
language research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
has focused on oral language production.

Mild to moderate AD patients have a typical
writing pattern characterised by reduced quantitative

Numerous studies (5–6) have found that deﬁcits in

Although there is relative preservation of motor

In a longitudinal spelling study on 22 AD patients
(MMSE ranging from 10 to 26), Platel et al. (12)
found agraphia to evolve through three phases
related to disease severity. The initial damage to
the semantic system caused an over-reliance on the
phonological system; therefore, the initial stage was

However, as the disease progressed into the second
stage, the phonological system was also impaired
and
errors were
dominant. Finally, in the third stage, output was
extremely limited and most errors were caused by
impaired
skills. Pestell, Shanks,
Warrington and Venneri (13), and Forbes et al. (8),
however, failed to differentiate mild–moderate AD
type. Although the

produced a large number of phonologically plausible

Numerous longitudinal studies have documented a
decline in narrative language performance among
AD patients, including deterioration in idea density
of written language (14–15), verbal ﬂuency (16),
semantic skills and sophistication of vocabulary in
writing (17–18), despite the relative preservation of
overall structure and syntax. In a case study by the
talented and accomplished writer, Iris Murdoch,
Garrard et al. (17) observed signs of deterioration in
her writing before her diagnosis of AD, especially in
semantic skills and sophistication of vocabulary.
More recent analyses across her
literary opus
revealed that subtle abnormalities in her writing
with impoverished vocabulary and syntax detectable
even in middle age, almost
two decades before
clinical diagnosis (18).

To date, no longitudinal assessment has been
carried out on the spontaneous narrative writing
skills of AD patients.

Aims of the study

The main aim of this study was to document the
progressive nature of the spontaneous writing impair-
ments occurring in minimal–moderate AD patients
using a standardised measure. In particular, this study
aimed to build up a proﬁle of the deterioration in
performance, on a simple and complex narrative
description task, over a period of 12 months.

If the writing impairment experienced by AD
patients is due to a primary breakdown in semantic
processing and secondary breakdown in phonological
processing, deﬁcits should be most evident on
those aspects of spontaneous writing that deal with
lexical semantic processing. Furthermore,
the
initial breakdown in lexical processing is followed
by a subsequent breakdown in visuospatial and
graphomotor skills,
the latter
measures should increase over time.

patients, as speciﬁed by the Grampian Health Board
and the University of Aberdeen Joint Ethics
Committee. Before administering the written picture
description task, a brief
interview was carried
out with each patient and their relative/guardian.
Only those patients who were able to give consent
were tested.

The 30 healthy controls (18 men and 12 women)

As an additional precaution to ensure normal
cognitive functioning at the time of assessment for
this study, all controls over the age of 80 were also
assessed with the MMSE. None of the participants
scored below 27/30.

The 31 patients (19 men and 12 women) were
aged between 53 and 90 years (mean 76.03, SD
8.56), with a mean of 11.71 (SD 3.01) years of

mean MMSE of 22.29 (SD 4.11), with a minimum
of 16 and a maximum of 29. According to the cut-
off scores established by Folstein (21), 16 patients
fell within the minimal range (24–30), 9 within the
mild range (19–24) and 6 within the moderate range
(12–18) of dementia severity.

Procedure

Study 1 – cross-sectional study. Before administering
the task,
there was a brief discussion with each
patient and their relative/guardian, and only those
able to consent were tested. Each individual was
instructed to describe in writing everything that
they could see happening in one simple and one
complex picture. The descriptions were transcribed
and later analysed on a writing analysis scale,
which comprised eight 7-point Likert-type scales
including: Goodglass and Kaplan’s (26) measures
for phrase
a
modiﬁed version of their measure for paraphasias,
in which semantic (words related to the target in
terms of meaning), visual (words related to the
target visually) and phonological (words that share
some similar sounds, initial phoneme or number
target) paraphasias were
of
measured separately; and three additional scales
measuring areas of writing known to deteriorate in

Each measure was scored on a 7-point Likert-
type scale ranging from 1 (severely impaired
functioning) to 7 (no abnormality) (see Forbes,
Venneri and Shanks (29)). For example, the scales
for paraphasias ranged from 1 (paraphasia present
in every sentence) to 7 (paraphasias absent) with
intervening scores representative of the proportion
of sentences containing a paraphasia. The scale for

Study 2 – longitudinal assessment. The procedure
for study 2 was the same as study 1; however, to
document the language deterioration suffered over
time, writing was reassessed after a period of
6 months and 12 months. To control for practice
effects the stimuli were rotated every 6 months; for
example,
if presented with the ‘Bus Stop’ and
‘Cookie Theft’ pictures at baseline, patients were
and the
‘Trafﬁc Chaos’
presented with the
‘Tripping Woman’ pictures at 6 months.

Statistical analysis

Baseline cross-sectional assessment. To examine
the effects of group (healthy controls and AD
patients), on the performance score of each speech
variable, a one-way ANOVA was carried out for
each writing measure.

Longitudinal assessment. To examine the effects
of time (baseline, 6 months and 12 months) on the
performance score of each writing variable, a one-
way repeated ANOVA was carried out for each
writing measure across all patients.
